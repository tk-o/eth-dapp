# dAPP â€” sending a raw transaction to the network

This example has been tested with the following networks:
- private (local blockchain powered by Ganache),
- ropsten (testnet),
- rinkeby (testnet).

## Installation
```
yarn
```

## Configuration
To run the dAPP, please add a network profile. Feel free to duplicate the `input/network/example` profile. You can quickly do it by running:
```
cp -r ./input/network/example ./input/network/ropsten
```
And then modifying the JSON files accordingly.

## Sending a transaction
```
# use `private` profile (i.e. to utiles Ganache local blockchain)
NETWORK_NAME=private node src

# use `rinkeby` network profile
NETWORK_NAME=rinkeby node src
 ```
